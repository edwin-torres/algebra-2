# 📘 Algebra II Sample Assessment Questions
### Created by Edwin Torres, Mathematics Instructor – Laredo College  

This repository showcases three **standards-aligned Algebra II assessment questions** authored in <a href="https://www.myopenmath.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MyOpenMath</a> using **IMathAS/PHP**.  
Each question integrates randomized variables, automated feedback, and modern HTML/CSS styling to promote clarity and engagement.

## 🎯 Purpose
To demonstrate effective assessment design that blends **conceptual understanding**, **procedural fluency**, and **technological innovation** through open-source mathematics content.

### 🧮 Question 1: *Modeling from Two Measurements* — Exponential Growth  
**Standards Alignment**  
- **Common Core:** 
  - **HSF.LE.A.2** — Construct linear and exponential functions, including arithmetic and geometric sequences, given a graph, a description of a relationship, or two input-output pairs (include reading these from a table).
  - **HSF.LE.B.5** — Interpret the parameters in a linear or exponential function in terms of a context.
- **Texas CCRS (2018):**  
  - **VI.C.1** – Apply known functions to model real-world situations.  
  - **VI.C.2** – Develop a function to model a situation.  
  - **VI.B.1** – Understand and analyze features of a function.  
  - **VII.D.1** – Interpret results of the mathematical problem in terms of the original real-world situation.  

**Description**  
Students use two measurements to determine the exponential model $\( y = A b^t \)$, compute the growth factor $\(b\)$, initial value $\(A\)$, percent growth rate, and the time needed to reach a target value.  

**Key Features**
- Randomized data pairs $\(t_1, y_1\)$ and $\(t_2, y_2\)$ for unique student versions  
- Multi-part numeric entry with rounding requirements  
- Automated validation and targeted feedback

### 📈 Question 2: *Vertex Form from Attributes + Interpretation* — Quadratic Functions  
**Standards Alignment**  
- **Common Core:**
  - **HSF-IF.C.8** — Write a function defined by an expression in different but equivalent forms to reveal and explain different properties of the function.
- **Texas CCRS (2018):**  
  - **II.D.2** – Convert among multiple representations of equations, inequalities, and relationships. 
  - **VI.C.2** – Develop a function to model a situation.  

**Description**  
Given a parabola’s vertex and a point on its path, students write the quadratic in **vertex form**, rewrite it in **standard form**, evaluate function values, and select the best interpretation of its key features.  

**Key Features**
- Randomized vertex and data point for each student  
- Symbolic entry boxes for multiple forms of the equation  
- Integrated multiple-choice reasoning prompt for conceptual check

### 🧠 Question 3: *Vertical Asymptote, Horizontal Asymptote, and Domain* — Rational Functions  
**Standards Alignment**  
- **Common Core:**
  - **HSF-IF.C.7.d** — Graph rational functions, identifying zeros and asymptotes when suitable factorizations are available, and showing end behavior.  
- **Texas CCRS (2018):**  
  - **VI.B.1** – Understand and analyze features of functions. 

**Description**  
Students analyze a rational function to determine vertical and horizontal asymptotes, excluded domain values, evaluate the function at a given input, and interpret long-term behavior.  

**Key Features**
- Randomized coefficients with nonzero differences  
- Multi-step conceptual reasoning through numeric and interpretive parts
